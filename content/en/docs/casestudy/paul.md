## Getting started

When a customer decides to purchase a product in your store, Bolt works with your server using two APIs that streamline on-page checkout.

Where the [Bolt API](https://help.bolt.com/api-bolt/) creates order tokens and manages transaction-related actions, the [Merchant API](https://help.bolt.com/developers/guides/checkout-guides/custom-cart-guides/how-to-integrate/merchant_api/) handles processes that occur during checkout, like discount codes, taxes, and shipping rates.

In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how the Merchant API works. No prior development experience is necessary.

With a practical example that uses the Merchant API's `cart.update` event, you'll gain insight into the following concepts:

* **How the Merchant API interacts with your server**
* **How to interpret Merchant API requests and responses**
* **How to identify and use potential response errors**

First up: getting to know APIs.

## Understanding APIs

<!--Since the task mentioned that this is oriented towards a non-technical audience, I tried not to assume that the reader knows what an API is. To that end, I've included a section explaining APIs from a high level before diving into the Merchant API, in particular. -->

APIs, or **application programming interfaces**, are software programs that enable communication between computers and servers. One program can request information from and send information to another program in order to perform certain tasks.

Web-based APIs, like Bolt's, often use HTTP protocols to foster this communication. These protocols define standardized **methods** that computers can use to exchange information.

The following list includes some of the most frequently used HTTP methods:

* `GET`, used to retrieve and read information
* `POST`, used to create information
* `PUT`, used to update information

When an order is created in your store, for example, your server uses the `POST` method to send information about the order to a Bolt **endpoint**, a digital location on Bolt's server that manages data. Bolt's API receives the order information and stores it on its server.

### Bolt's Merchant API

<!--Answers: "who is sending the request?"" -->

During checkout, Bolt's Merchant API retrieves and sends information to your server to handle operations like tax calculation and cart updates.

#### How the API updates carts

<!--Answers: "What has the shopper changed about their cart?" -->

To illustrate the process, suppose a customer visits your online shop, Dogecoin Swag Store. After adding a pair of sunglasses to their cart, they change their mind and decide to purchase a t-shirt instead. It just so happens to be June 21st, the summer solstice, which reminds the customer of a discount code they received from you via email.

To make these changes, the Merchant API uses the `cart.update` event, which updates the customer's cart.  The `cart.update` event requires the following:

<!--Answers: "What is the endpoint?  what is the method?" -->

* An endpoint on your store's server, in this case `/cart_update`
* An HTTP method, in this case, `POST`, that your server understands
* A properly formatted **payload** that contains the new cart information

<!-- Note: I didn't include all request requirements (like authorization). Since this is a high-level explainer and not a reference guide, I focused just on the elements necessary for the reader to understand the basics. -->

Since you've already implemented Merchant API endpoints on your server, the Merchant API sends its `POST` request to the following resource:

```curl
https://dogecoinswagstore.com/api/cart_update
```

#### Understanding the JSON payload

APIs often exchange information using **JSON**, a format for sending and receiving data.

To update your customer's cart to reflect the t-shirt and discount code they've added, the Bolt Merchant API sends your server the following JSON payload:

```JSON
"event": "cart.update",
  "data": {
    "order_reference": "order-004",
    "add_items": [
      {
        "product_id": "t-shirt-floral-44",
        "price": 999,
        "currency": "USD",
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ],
    "remove_items": [
      {
        "product_id": "sunglasses-456",
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ],
    "discount_codes_to_add": [
      "SUMMERFUN15"
    ],
    "cart": {
      "order_reference": "order-12345",
      "display_id": "ID-12345",
      "billing_address": {
        "street_address1": "42 Wallaby Way",
        "street_address2": "42 Wallaby Way",
        "locality": "Kings County",
        "region": "New York",
        "postal_code": "11209",
        "country_code": "US",
        "country": "United States",
        "name": "Paul Sherman",
        "first_name": "Paul",
        "last_name": "Sherman",
        "phone": "867-5309",
        "email": "my.email@gmail.com"
      },
      "shipments": {
        "shipping_address_id": "address-1",
        "shipping_address": {
          "street_address1": "340 86th street",
          "street_address2": "APT 220",
          "locality": "Kings County",
          "region": "New York",
          "postal_code": "11209",
          "country_code": "US",
          "country": "United States",
          "name": "Charlotte Charles",
          "first_name": "Charlotte",
          "last_name": "Charles",
          "phone": "123-4567",
          "email": "my.email@gmail.com"
        },
        "total_weight": 55,
        "total_weight_unit": "kg",
        "shipping_method": "Shipping Method",
        "carrier": "FedEx",
        "reference": "1123",
        "signature": "a1B2s3dC4f5g5D6hj6E7k8F9l0",
        "service": "Option 1",
        "expedited": false,
        "cost": 1200,
        "tax_amount": 300,
        "package_type": "Standard",
        "package_width": 222,
        "package_height": 103,
        "package_depth": 90,
        "package_dimension_unit": "cm",
        "estimated_delivery_date": "08-30-2022",
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Breaking the payload down into parts shows the key information the Merchant API has sent. This `cart.update` request contains several objects that pass the data your server needs to update the customer's cart.  

First, the `add_items` array adds the `t-shirt-floral-44` product to the customer's cart, while `remove_items` deletes `sunglasses-456`, the sunglasses the customer no longer wants:

```JSON
"add_items": [
  {
    "product_id": "t-shirt-floral-44",
    "price": 999,
    "currency": "USD",
    "quantity": 1
  }
],
"remove_items": [
  {
    "product_id": "sunglasses-456",
    "quantity": 1
  }
]  
```

<!--Answers: "How do Bolt and the Merchant both know they're updating the correct order?"; "who is paying for the order?" -->

Next, the `cart` object confirms the order reference number so that your server associates the payload with the correct order. The `cart` object also contains the customer's billing information:

```JSON
"cart": {
     "order_reference": "order-12345",
     "display_id": "ID-12345",
     "billing_address": {
       "street_address1": "42 Wallaby Way",
       "street_address2": "42 Wallaby Way",
       "locality": "Kings County",
       "region": "New York",
       "postal_code": "11209",
       "country_code": "US",
       "country": "United States",
       "name": "Paul Sherman",
       "first_name": "Paul",
       "last_name": "Sherman",
       "phone": "867-5309",
       "email": "my.email@gmail.com"
     }
   }
```

Your store now knows that the customer, `Paul Sherman`, has made changes to order `12345.` Mr. Sherman plans to ship the order to a different address, though, shown in the `shipments` object:

```JSON
"shipments": {
        "shipping_address_id": "address-1",
        "shipping_address": {
          "street_address1": "340 86th street",
          "street_address2": "APT 220",
          "locality": "Kings County",
          "region": "New York",
          "postal_code": "11209",
          "country_code": "US",
          "country": "United States",
          "name": "Charlotte Charles",
          "first_name": "Charlotte",
          "last_name": "Charles",
          "phone": "123-4567",
          "email": "my.email@gmail.com"
        }
      }
```

In the next section, you'll learn how to interpret responses your server sends back to the Merchant API.

#### Reading API request responses

After your server receives a request from the Merchant API, it responds with an HTTP **status code** that tells Bolt if the original request succeeded or failed.

This **response** is typically formatted in JSON, like the request and payload in the `cart.update` request in the previous section.

<!--Answers: "What would a successfully added discount code look like in JSON?" -->

For example, suppose Mr. Sherman adds the `SUMMERFUN15` discount code to his cart. After Bolt verifies the code's validity, it uses the `POST` method to instruct your server to apply the discount:

```JSON
  "event": "discounts.code.apply",
  "data": {
    "discount_code": "SUMMERFUN15",
    "cart": {
      "order_reference": "order-12345",
      "display_id": "ID-12345",
      "currency": {
        "currency": "USD",
        "currency_symbol": "$"
        },
      },
    }
```

After your store server receives and successfully processes the request, it replies with an HTTP `200` status code, indicating the request's success:

```JSON
  "event": "discounts.code.apply",
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "discount_code": "SUMMERFUN15",
    "description": "Take 15% off of your order.",
    "discount_type": "percentage",
    "discount_amount": 754,
    "category": "hats"
    }
  }
```
<!--Answers: "What kinds of issues could cause this request to receive an error response?" -->

Sometimes, though, a Merchant API request fails. Your server's response includes an **error code** that tells Bolt what caused the failure and what action(s) your customer needs to take.  

Checkout issues that could produce error responses include the following:

* An item in a customer's cart is no longer available.
* A customer's session times out due to inactivity.
* A discount code can't be applied to certain items.

Suppose, for example, that the t-shirt Mr. Sherman added to his cart isn't eligible for a discount. After Bolt tries to apply the discount via the `cart.update` request, your server would respond with HTTP status code `422`, indicating that the request failed, and error code `2001006`, which specifies the failure reason:

```JSON
"event": "cart.update",
"status": "failure",
"errors": [
    {
      "code": 2001006,
      "message": "One or more items in the cart are not eligible for discount. Please refresh and try again."
    }
  ]
}
```

Detailed error code messages help you and your shoppers identify and resolve potential checkout issues. For a comprehensive list of recommended error codes, see Bolt's [error code developer reference](https://help.bolt.com/developers/references/error-codes/).
