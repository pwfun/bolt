## What's new?

Some text here

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="No prior knowledge of GraphQL is required, though some familiarity with query languages will benefit you throughout this guide." />}}

## New Feature Heading

GraphQL services require [object types, fields](#), and functions. With these three building blocks, you can create a GraphQL service by following these steps:

1. Define an object type.
2. Define fields on the object type.
3. Provide functions for each field and type.
